# Master Thesis - Dynamic Borrowing to Inform Linear Models

**University**: KU Leuven  
**Program**: Master of Statistics and Data Science (2024-2025)  
**Authors**: Fan Yu and Peihong Qin

## Abstract

This master thesis investigates the effectiveness of dynamic borrowing methods for independently estimating multiple parameters in linear regression models under both compatible and incompatible scenarios between historical and current data. We compare two dynamic borrowing approaches (RMP and CP) with traditional complete borrowing (FUBO) and no borrowing (NOBO) strategies to evaluate their performance under different data compatibility scenarios.

## Methods Included

- **RMP (Robust Mixture Prior)** - Bayesian and MLE approaches
- **CP (Commensurate Prior)** - Bayesian and MLE approaches  
- **NOBO (No Borrowing)** - Bayesian and MLE approaches
- **FUBO (Full Borrowing)** - Bayesian and MLE approaches

## Usage

Each simulation folder contains ready-to-run code for compatible scenarios. For incompatible scenarios, simply modify the parameter values at the beginning of each file as described in the respective README files.
